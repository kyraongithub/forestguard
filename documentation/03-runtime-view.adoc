- 1 General Component Communication
- 2 Transaction related schemes and definitions
- 3 Use Cases and process flows

== General Component Communication

All inter-component communication is carried out using JSON messages.
This communication occurs either through direct REST interactions from the frontend to the BFF (Backend for Frontend), or for inter-service communication, via an AMQP messaging queue via a broker instance, as provided by https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ].

== Transaction related schemes and definitions

This Chapter outlines all available APIs in the following Order:

1. The Blockchain Connector which accepts AMQP messages related to the process.
2. The Api exposed through the BFF which the Unisoft Frontend uses to query for data.

=== AMQP specific messaging interfaces and API
